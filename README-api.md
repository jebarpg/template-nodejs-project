Welcome to the TypeDoc API documentation! This guide will help you navigate the documents and get the most value out of them. Below are some tips and tricks to enhance your experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Navigating the Documentation

- **Home Page**: The home page usually contains an overview of the project and links to major sections.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between modules, classes, interfaces, functions, and other members. The hierarchy is structured to reflect the project structure.
- **Search Bar**: Utilize the search bar at the top to quickly find specific entities (classes, functions, etc.) by name.

### 2. Understanding the Layout

- **Modules**: Group related classes, interfaces, and functions together. Think of modules as namespaces.
- **Classes**: Represent the main objects in the project. Classes contain properties, methods, and events.
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts that classes or objects should adhere to.
- **Functions**: Standalone blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

## Detailed View

### 1. Class/Interface Pages

- **Hierarchy**: Shows the inheritance chain for classes.
- **Implements**: Lists interfaces implemented by the class.
- **Properties and Methods**: Detailed descriptions of each property and method, including types, return values, and descriptions.
- **Constructors**: Information on how to instantiate the class.

### 2. Function Pages

- **Signature**: Displays the function signature with parameter and return types.
- **Parameters**: Each parameter is listed with its type and description.
- **Returns**: Details about what the function returns.

## Useful Features

### 1. Source Links

- **View Source**: Many documentation pages provide links to the source code. This is useful if you need to see the implementation details.

### 2. Examples

- **Code Examples**: Look for code examples within the documentation to understand how to use a particular class, function, or module.

### 3. Comments and Tags

- **Documentation Comments**: Pay attention to documentation comments (usually indicated by `/** ... */`). These often include valuable information, examples, and usage tips.
- **Tags**: Look for tags like `@param`, `@returns`, `@example`, and `@deprecated`. These provide additional context and important notes.

## Tips and Tricks

### 1. Efficient Searching

- **Use Specific Keywords**: If you know the name of a class or function, type it directly into the search bar.
- **Partial Matches**: The search function supports partial matches. Typing part of a name can help if you’re unsure of the full name.

### 2. Bookmarking

- **Bookmark Frequently Used Pages**: If you find yourself returning to certain parts of the documentation frequently, bookmark those pages for quick access.

### 3. Exploring Related Items

- **Related Links**: Many pages include links to related classes, functions, or modules. Use these links to explore related documentation and gain a broader understanding.

### 4. Keeping Up to Date

- **Check for Updates**: Documentation is often updated alongside the codebase. Periodically check the documentation for new or updated content.

## Conclusion

The TypeDoc API documentation is a powerful resource for understanding and utilizing your project’s API. By leveraging the tips and features outlined above, you can navigate the documentation more efficiently and make the most of the information available. Happy coding!
