## Tips

REMEMBER: ***EsLint changes*** reload your Visual Studio Code with `Ctrl+Shift+P` type ***'reload'*** and select `Developer: Reload Window` to make sure that any changes made to [`.eslintignore`](../.eslintignore) or [`.eslintrc.json`](../.eslintrc.json) are updated for your Visual Studio Code environment. If you don't do this your changes won't be reflected in your environment and you might think something is not working correctly or get warning messages that don't actually apply anymore.
