# Generic Commit Messages

If you are making a commit without using the `cz` commit or the `bun cm` or `bun cm2` scripts then these are handy to copy and used to format your commits with. Also check out [this gist guide](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c#commit-message-header) to get a deeper understanding and intuition on how the commit messages are intended to be formatted.

## Examples of when you would use these

- Doing a merge in Visual Studio Code and are prompted with VIM to enter a message.
- When you need to do a manual `git commit -m ""` on the CLI.
- When you are using the Visual Studio Code Source Control tab to make a commit using it's message text box.

## Scoped example

```plaintext
🐛 fix(scopeName): Message
```

## Non Scope example

```plaintext
🐛 fix: fixing merge
```

## Emojis and Type names

Click the type of message you would like to use below and copy into your commit message. Remember to change teh scope to the appropriate scope of your project if you choose a scoped message.
