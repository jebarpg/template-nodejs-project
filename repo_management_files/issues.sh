- [ ] Create a GPG key and add it to your GitHub account.
- [ ] Follow [these instructions](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/83-github-personal-access-tokens-local-dev) to add the following environment variables to either your ~/.bashrc or system environment variables on windows
	- [ ] export GH_TOKEN={your_github_PAT}
